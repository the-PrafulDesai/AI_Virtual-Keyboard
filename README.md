Virtual Keyboard
Virtual Keyboard is a software application developed by Praful Desai that emulates a standard keyboard using OpenCV. 
It provides a picture of a keyboard on the computer screen, allowing users to enter text by pointing and clicking on the virtual keys. 
This project aims to provide an alternative input method for individuals who may have difficulty using a physical keyboard. 
This README document provides an overview of the project and instructions for setting it up on your local machine.

1) Introduction
Virtual Keyboard is a software application developed using OpenCV, an open-source computer vision library. 
The application aims to provide a virtual representation of a standard keyboard on the computer screen, enabling users to input text by clicking on the virtual keys.
This can be especially beneficial for individuals with physical impairments or those who prefer an alternative input method. 
The project uses image processing techniques to detect user interactions with the virtual keyboard and convert them into text input.

2) Features
The Virtual Keyboard application offers the following features:

- Virtual Keyboard Display: The application displays a virtual keyboard on the computer screen using OpenCV.
- Mouse Interaction: Users can interact with the virtual keyboard by pointing and clicking on the virtual keys using the mouse.
- Text Input: User interactions are processed and converted into text input, allowing users to enter text using the virtual keyboard.
- Customizable Layout: The layout and appearance of the virtual keyboard can be customized to suit individual preferences.

3) Getting Started
To set up the Virtual Keyboard project on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone <repository-url>
Install the required dependencies (see the Dependencies section).
Build and compile the project using your preferred IDE or build tools.
Run the application on your machine.
  
4) Project Structure
The project structure is as follows:

     └── main.py
.idea: The main source file that contains the application logic and user interface.
venv: The header file defining the Virtual Keyboard class and its functions.
main.py: The CMake configuration file for building the project.
  
5) Dependencies
The Virtual Keyboard project depends on the following libraries:
OpenCV: An open-source computer vision library used for image processing and graphical user interface (GUI).
Make sure you have OpenCV installed on your system before building and running the project.

6) Usage
To use the Virtual Keyboard application:
Run the compiled application on your machine.
The virtual keyboard will be displayed on the screen.
Use your mouse to point and click on the virtual keys to enter text.
The entered text will be displayed on the screen or can be saved to a file, depending on the implementation.
