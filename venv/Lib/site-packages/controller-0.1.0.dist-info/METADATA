Now, it`s possible to use your phone as a controller to develop games and interactive programs in python!
**ControllerApp** is a tool that allows you to catch all sorts of UI events like a simple tap on your mobile's screen or a device's acceleration directly in your Python code. 

## App Installation

The app is available at [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ml.controllerapp.controllerapp).

## Python Package Installation


Install the controller package using **pip**:
```
 pip install controller
```

## How to use

The communication works with a 6-letters code: it`s enought to put the same code in both App and Python code to start using it.
In the app, the code field is ommited: You just need to minimize the square to make it appears!

In the Python side, you can test the tap functionality with the following example:

```python
from controller import Controller

c = Controller('a1b2c3') '''room code'''

def myFunction(x,y):
    print('hello world',x,y)

c.mobile.onTap = myFunction 

```
